# Reinvestify
A web based application for real estate investors.

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to develop/showcase my programming skill set by building an application based on my interests. 
A user can calculate real estate metrics by entering assumptions such as purchase price, mortgage info, and monthly rent. 

The backend was built using Python's Flask framework and a MYSQL database, hosted on AWS Relational Database Service. 
Pages are built in HTML with CSS styling and Javascript to improve responsiveness. 
The application was deployed on a Free Tier instance of AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 

## Lessons Learned
This project was crucial in my development as a software engineer. 

I learned more than just programming concepts. I developed my soft skills such as resourcefulness, self sufficiency, and persistence. 

Besides the Bootstrap CSS template, this entire application was built from scratch. There was no tutorial to guide me from step A to Z.
Instead, I was forced to break down large problems into smaller chunks, solve the smaller problems, and put it all back together.
I learned how frustrating bugs can be, wanting to quit midway, but pushing through a successful feature implementation.
I learned how to set deadlines so the project would not drag on indefinitely and how to use project management software such as Trello to track all outstanding items.  

The time spent on this project was just under 2 months (52 days), which included a few hours everyday after work (Monday - Friday) and 4-8 hours on (Saturday/Sunday). 
The estimated total time to completion was 160 hours and every single hour was worth it. 

With this experience, I am confident that I can learn new technologies for any task.
