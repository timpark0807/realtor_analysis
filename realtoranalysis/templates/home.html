                                This application allows a user to calculate profitability metrics based on property detail and assumptions.
                                The report will show capitalization rates, cash on cash returns, and monthly cash flow projections. I have also included a 30 year model for cash flow as well as equity.

                              <p>The backend was built using Python's Flask framework and a MYSQL database hosted on AWS Relational Database Service.
                                Pages are built in HTML with CSS styling and Javascript to improve responsiveness.
                                The application was deployed on a Free Tier instance of Amazon Web Services Elastic Beanstalk.
